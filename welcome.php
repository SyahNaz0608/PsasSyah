        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically only a human could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems. It encompasses a wide variety of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).</p>
        <p>Although there are philosophical debates about whether we've achieved “true” intelligent machines, when most people use the term AI today, they’re referring to machine learning-powered technologies like Chat GPT or computer vision.</p>
